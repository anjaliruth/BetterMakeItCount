# BetterMakeItCount

I embarked on this project after being inspired by Ali Abdaal's Sunday Snippets on maximizing productivity. His suggestion to track work time using a YouTube video resonated with me, but I wanted to create a more streamlined solution.

In this app:
1️⃣ Easily start and stop the timer to accurately measure work sessions.
2️⃣ Each session displays a timestamp and the elapsed time, capturing productive periods.
3️⃣ Track your daily total work time, providing a clear overview of your accomplishments.
4️⃣ Gain insights from the intuitive dashboard, presenting the weekly totals of your work sessions.

## What I learned in this project: 
I discovered the importance of separating time calculations and their display. Distinguishing between pure and derived states—user input versus calculated values—proved invaluable. Storing derived states as variables, rather than useState hooks, streamlined the implementation of pure states.

## Functionalities to add: 
1️⃣ Incorporate background music to prompt users to pause the timer during distractions.
2️⃣ Create multiple timers for different areas of life (e.g., work, gym, family, play).
3️⃣ Develop a dedicated dashboard for detailed analysis of time allocation across categories on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
